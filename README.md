# Project overview


This streamlit application called Fintech Finder created in the project helps to hire a fintech professional and pay them with ether using the user's crypto wallet. This is achieved by integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

# Technologies Required 

1. Python version 3.8.5: This project leveraes Python and specifically the following packages and modules:

a). Pandas - version 1.3.2 - This was used to be able to easily manipulate dataframes and create dataframes.

b). Streamlit - version 0.84.2 - To be able to view the application into a web browser and that users can interact with the ledger.

c). Data Classes -This module provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods to classes, which managed us to use class blocks into our code structure.

d).  datetime - While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation. In our case, we used this to be able to determine the UTC timezoon to create a time stamp in our blockchain.

e). typing- This allows us to use the most fundamental support consisting of the types Any, Union, Tuple, Callable, TypeVar, and Generic.

f). hashlib- This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. In our application, we use SHA256 to return a hexdigest.

g.) web3.py - This is a Python library for connecting to and performing operations on Ethereum-based blockchains.

h). eth-tester - This is a Python library that provides access to the tools weâ€™ll use to test Ethereum-based applications.

i). mnemonic - This is a Python implementation for generating a 12- or 24-word mnemonic seed phrase based on the BIP-39 standard.

j). bip44 - This is a Python implementation for deriving hierarchical deterministic wallets from a seed phrase based on the BIP-44 standard.

k). Infura API - An API that provides instant access to the Ethereum network over HTTPS (i.e., the web). You will need to create an account with Infura.

# Installations

Pip install the following applications and make sure they work properly:


. pip install streamlit

. pip install web3==5.17

. pip install eth-tester==0.5.0b3 or pip install eth-tester

. pip install mnemonic

. pip install bip44

# Demonstrations:

Use VScode to open and lauch the Fintech_finder.py file( see the image below for the launch area)

![streamlit launched ](https://github.com/shangfii/Crypto_Wallet_Fintech_Finder/blob/main/Fintech_finder/Images/Streamlit_app_launch.png)

When streamlit opens; the left site should look like the image below(Streamlit ready for transaction)

When a transaction is done; the following image shows what you will see

A scan of the senders wallet on the Kovan testnet (Sender's Kovan scan)

Conclusion:

Overall the project is a success, The images above show that a Fintech profesional can be hired and paid directly from the streamlit application and the transacton visible on the scan. Although this used the testnet, it can be intergrated and used in the mainnet to functoin as illustrated here. 

This application could be improved by adding a link to the proffessional's resume and developement background page. Hiring a professional requires more to consider than what we have here.
